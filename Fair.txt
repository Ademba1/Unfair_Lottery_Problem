In this solution, we define 'fair' as each winner receiving an equal share of the total prize value, rounded down to the nearest integer. 
If the total prize value is not evenly divisible by the number of winners, then the remaining prize value is distributed among the remaining winners, starting with the first winner in the list. 
This ensures that each winner receives a fair share of the total prize value, while also minimizing the difference between the value of the prizes received by each winner.

In this solution, I define 'fair' as distributing the prizes as equally as possible among the winners.

If the total value of the prizes is not evenly divisible by the number of winners, then the remaining prize value is distributed among the winners in a way that maximizes the fairness (i.e., the difference in prize value between any two winners is minimized).

In this case, I distribute the remaining prize value by giving each winner an additional prize until the remaining prize value is exhausted or all winners have received the same number of prizes.

To accomplish this, I first read in the prizes and winners from the input. 

I then calculate the total value of the prizes and the prize value per winner.

I use these values to initialize a map that associates each winner with a list of prizes they have won. 

I then iterate through the prizes and assign them to the winners in a round-robin fashion, starting over from the first winner after each winner has received the prize value per winner number of prizes. 

Any remaining prizes are assigned to the winners in a way that maximizes the fairness.

Finally, I print out the prize distribution by iterating through the map and printing out the winner and their list of prizes.

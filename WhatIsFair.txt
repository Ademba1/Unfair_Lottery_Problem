I define 'fair' as distributing the prizes as evenly as possible among the winners, such that each winner gets a prize value as close as possible to the others. 
In the case where the prizes cannot be divided, 'fair' means distributing the prizes in a way that results in the lowest difference between the highest and lowest prize values among the winners.
